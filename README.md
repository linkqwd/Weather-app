### known issues
- Timezone issue, currently daily forecast and sunrise\sunset shows correct data only for GMT+2 timezone.
Unfortunatley, used API doesn't have timezones about requested region;
- Empty 'div' wrappers among layout which wraps Components;
- Tested and designed only in\for Chrome browser.

### further improvements
- Changing color themes, at least dark\light themes;
- Weather background graphics which would depend on current weather
